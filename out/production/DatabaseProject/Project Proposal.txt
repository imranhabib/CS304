Project Proposal: Player Management Application

	The domain that we’re going to model will be a soccer player management domain. In other words, the type of information needed to categorize players within teams, and in the sport as a whole. 
	The aspects we will be modelling will be data relevant to each player on a particular team. Aspects of the data stored will include player name, age, salary, nationality, price, availability, and position. Furthermore, to classify players that may have identical names, we use squad number (# on jersey); i.e. in the rare case two or more players have the same name, and are on the same team, they cannot have the same squad number.
On a specific team, there are several players, each with a different availability for the frequent scenario when a player is sought to be purchased. Depending upon the availability, each player will contain an adjusted price value. For example, if a player is available to buy their price may be lower to attract buyers. Similarly, in the player is not for sale, their price may be higher, to reflect a need to pay more to convince the team to sale. Moreover, the player can have a third status of ‘loan’ (rent). In this case, the price is null, since the new team has only taken on the salary of the player. 
In terms of data classes, we will implement the application with two; managers and players. Managers will have extensive rights to view and update player information from their respective team only. Players will be able to view only their information, and they will be able to update their personal information only (name, age, nationality). 
This project will be completed using the CS’s department’s oracle database using Java and JDBC.
